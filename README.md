## Generating man pages for translations

- Copy the `en.yml` file under the `locales` directory, rename it to your language code then translate the strings.
- Once the translation is complete, perform `go build` and execute this command `LANG=<language_code> ./abroot man > man/<language_code>/abroot.1`. If the man page gets generated without errors, open a PR here.
